# Face2Comic: A cGAN approach to cartoonify human protraits

## 1. Introduction
This is a project submission for my final semester in Master's in Computer Application. During this short span due to ongoing internal conflict in Manipur, I build and develop a Image Generative model where it converts Human potraits into Cartoon version of it. It is not fully accurate but It works quite well. I've uploaded all the source coded along with the documentation as well.

## 2. Model
The trained model can be assessed on the HuggingFace website
