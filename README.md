# Face2Comic: A cGAN approach to cartoonify human protraits

This is a project submission for my final semester in Master's in Computer Application. During this short span due to ongoing internal conflict in Manipur, I build and develop a Image Generative model where it converts Human potraits into Cartoon version of it. It is not fully accurate but It works quite well. I've uploaded all the source coded along with the documentation as well.
