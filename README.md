# Face2Comic: A cGAN approach to cartoonify human portraits

## 1. Introduction
This project submission is for my final semester in the Master of Computer Application program. Amid the challenging circumstances arising from the ongoing internal conflict in Manipur, I developed an image generative model that converts human portraits into cartoon-style illustrations. While the model is not fully accurate, it performs quite effectively. Due to limited GPU access, the training was carried out on a Google Colab T4 GPU, which imposed certain constraints on the training duration and performance. I have also provided the complete source code and accompanying documentation for reference.

## 2. Model
The trained model can be assessed on the HuggingFace website
